# [OriginVault](https://www.originvault.io) Namespaces - v1

Welcome to the `v1` namespace of OriginVault. This namespace defines the initial version of the DID Method Specification for the OriginVault ecosystem, enabling decentralized identifiers (DIDs) for robust and secure interactions.

## Overview

The `v1` namespace is the foundation for OriginVault's DID implementation. It provides detailed specifications and guidelines for creating and interacting with DIDs, ensuring interoperability, security, and compliance with decentralized standards.

## Key Features

- **Decentralized Identifier (DID) Method Specification**:
  - Detailed documentation on how DIDs are created, resolved, and updated in the OriginVault ecosystem.
  - Support for both traditional and quantum-safe cryptographic mechanisms.
- **Interoperability**:
  - Built to align with W3C DID standards, ensuring compatibility with other DID implementations.
- **Security**:
  - Emphasizes secure key management and cryptographic practices.

## Documentation

### Core Specifications

- [DID Method Specification](./did_method_specification.md): Details the processes for creating, resolving, and updating DIDs.

### Supporting Schemas

1. **Generated By Schema** ([View Schema](./generated-by-schema.json)):
   - Specifies metadata about the entity or system responsible for generating content or operations.

2. **Generation Details Schema** ([View Schema](./generation-details-schema.json)):
   - Captures additional details about content or data generation processes, including timestamps and parameters used.

3. **Generator Schema** ([View Schema](./generator-schema.json)):
   - Defines the attributes and specifications of the entity or mechanism that generates outputs in the system.

4. **Inputs Schema** ([View Schema](./inputs-schema.json)):
   - Structures the input data required for various processes, including validation and execution.

5. **Mark Schema** ([View Schema](./mark-schema.json)):
   - Provides the format for applying marks, such as watermarks or other identifiers, to content or operations.

6. **Merkle Proof Schema** ([View Schema](./merkle-proof-schema.json)):
   - Details how to validate cryptographic proofs for Merkle Tree-based operations.

7. **Multi-Signature Schema** ([View Schema](./multi-signature-schema.json)):
   - Defines the structure for multi-signature operations, including roles, thresholds, and weights.

8. **Permissions Schema** ([View Schema](./permissions-schema.json)):
   - Structures access controls and permission levels for entities within the ecosystem.

9. **Platform Metadata Schema** ([View Schema](./platform-metadata-schema.json)):
   - Specifies metadata related to the platform, including versioning, supported features, and configuration details.

10. **Proof Schema** ([View Schema](./proof-schema.json)):
    - Outlines the structure for cryptographic proofs used in various validation processes.

11. **Role Schema** ([View Schema](./role-schema.json)):
    - Provides a structure for role-based access control, permissions, and weight assignments.

12. **Roles Schema** ([View Schema](./roles-schema.json)):
    - Extends the role schema to support multiple roles and hierarchical role management.

13. **Signature Schema** ([View Schema](./signature-schema.json)):
    - Describes how cryptographic signatures are generated, validated, and associated with operations.

14. **Token Schema** ([View Schema](./token-schema.json)):
    - Outlines the format for managing tokens within the OriginVault ecosystem.

15. **Verifiable Credential Schema** ([View Schema](./vc-schema.json)):
    - Specifies the structure for verifiable credentials, ensuring compliance with W3C standards.

## Usage

### How to Get Started

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/OriginVault/originvault-namespaces.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the `v1` directory:
   ```bash
   cd originvault-namespaces/v1
   ```

### Key Operations

1. **Creating a DID**:
   Follow the steps outlined in the [DID Method Specification](./did_method_specification.md) to generate a new DID.

2. **Resolving a DID**:
   Use the resolution process described to retrieve DID documents securely.

3. **Updating a DID**:
   Learn how to securely update DIDs in compliance with the `v1` specification.
